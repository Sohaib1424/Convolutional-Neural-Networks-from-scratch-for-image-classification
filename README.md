# Convolutional Neural Networks from scratch for image classification

In this repository, you can find Convolutional Neural Networks written in numpy from scratch (no framework involved) that trains by mini-batches.
In the related notebook, we'll use a pre-trained model to recognize and classify images of handwritten digits.
